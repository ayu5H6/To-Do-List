# To-Do-List

Welcome to my React Todo List App! This project is a simple yet functional task manager where you can add new tasks, move them up and down the list, and delete them as needed. Built with React and styled using Bootstrap, this app serves as a learning project to practice and improve my skills in React and front-end development. While it may not be perfect or feature-rich, it represents a significant step in my journey to becoming proficient in web development.
